================================================================================

Django-based webserver to control Interactive Led DISplay.

To run in debug, use:

$ source venv/bin/activate
$ ILDIS_DEBUG=TRUE daphne ildis.asgi:application

License: AGPLv3 or (at your option) any later version. See COPYING.


Production setup
================

To run this in production, you need to set up (at least) the following things:

- make a venv for this project (python -m venv venv)
- load the venv and install all dependencies
- test if you have all the dependencies by running the development version with
  $ python3 manage.py runserver
- Create the static files
  $ python3 manage.py collectstatic
- install daphne for the websockets/channels
- test again whether the setup now works with daphne
- add the service files of both ildis and leddie to systemd and enable and
  start them.
- install apache2 and apache2-mod-wsgi. Set up the apache file so that
  the wsgi is started and the static files are served statically.
- make sure the required files (eg database file and python files) are
  accessible to apache, by adding them to the group www-data.
- run apache.
- test whether the site now works when you go to it directly on the local
  ip.
- set up the reverse proxy on the main server (if applicable)
